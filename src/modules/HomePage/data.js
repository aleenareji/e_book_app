  { name: "The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake by Aimee Bender", content: "The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake sounds like a metaphor, but in this book, it's both allegorical and literal, as the protagonist, a young girl, eats feelings that aren't her own. With each bite she takes, she absorbs the feelings of whoever made it. So when she bites into a lemon cake baked by her mother, she discovers that under the cheer and love, there is a deep despair. Aimee Bender is a true master when it comes to drawing us into the interior worlds of people and describing the most mundane things with such poignancy you could cry." },
  { name: "As I Lay Dying by William Faulkner", content: "What is a round of books with life-changing abilities without at least one William Faulkner shout-out? As I Lay Dying takes on a unique form, as it's first told from the perspective of a dead matriarch and then by living members of her family." },
  { name: "Skippy Dies by Paul Murray", content: "The title spells out exactly what happens in the book, but just because we know the plot and the point of tension doesn't mean we can't be emotionally affected by the story and all the other things that stories do aside from the plot. This is one of those books that's written for teens but makes an impact on adults, too." },
